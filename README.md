This is the personal blog of iowafloyd.

I'm a degreed mechanical engineer with about 15 years experience in these industries:
* Aerospace and defense
* Commercial electronics
* Industrial rotating machinery

But in my free time, I enjoy coding. I've been a "computer geek" since I was around 8 years old, playing DOS games on my dad's 8086. Over the years, I've learned several languages:
* QBASIC (c. 1996) to program the buttons on my Thrustmaster FLCS
* HTML, CSS and Javascript (c. 1998-2002) to have my own website on Geocities
* C++ (c. 2002) for a high school elective
* Python, React, etc. (c. 2020 - present) for lots of fun personal projects
