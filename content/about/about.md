# About me

## Hi, I'm Cameron

To answer your first question, I was born and raised in the great state of **Iowa, USA**, and my favorite band has always been **Pink Floyd**. Hence the name, iowafloyd.

## (Formal) Education

I have a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, and I've worked in several industries since the late 20-aughts, including:
- Aerospace & Defense
- Commercial electronics
- Industrial rotating machinery

## (Informal) Education

Working in these industries has been interesting, challenging, rewarding, and fun. When not doing that, I enjoy coding in my free time. I find coding to be so much more creative than engineering. You're not limited to pesky things like physics. These are the main languages I've used:

- QBASIC for programming the buttons on my Thrustmaster FLCS
- HTML, CSS, Javascript for writing my first webpages on Geocities
- C++ as a high school elective and again in college
- Python (Numpy, SciPi, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch) for personal data science projects

## General Nerdiness

In general, I'm a total nerd.

I'm a contemporary polyglot of the following subjects:

- Sci-Fi novels
- Math (in all its many flaors)
- Physics (Newtonian)
- Physics (Quantum)
