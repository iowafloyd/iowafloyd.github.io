# About me

## Hi, I'm Cameron.

To answer your first question, I was born and raised in the great state of **Iowa, USA**, and my favorite band has always been **Pink Floyd**. Hence the name, iowafloyd.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, and I've worked in several industries since the late 20-aughts.

When not doing that, I enjoy coding in my free time. Ideally I would find a career that merges both. **Robotics**, anyone?
