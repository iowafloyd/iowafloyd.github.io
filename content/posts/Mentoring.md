With the recent retirement of a good friend and colleague of mine, I'm now the most senior engineer at Viking Pump who isn't in management. Though I'm not officially in charge of anyone's work and have no "direct reports", I do use my knowledge of our products and processes to help the less-tenured engineers wherever possible.
