## What College Doesn't Teach
One thing that my ABET-accredited degree did not teach me was just how much I would need some form of project managment in my professional life.

Maybe that's because, depending on the company you work for once you graduate, you may or may not need to have project management skills. Or maybe project management is just hard to teach out of a textbook. As someone who enjoys teaching others, I bet the latter is the true reason.

I've worked for three companies thus far in my career, but by and large most of that tenure has been spent with just one company, my current one. They're well-established, having begun back in the early 1900's, and they employ several hundred people (it's always changing, but it's more than 500 and less than 1,000). So, they're a good "medium-sized company". That might not be impressive compared to well-known brands such as John Deere, Boeing, Caterpillar, Lockheed Martin, etc... but I can say that this company has products on all sevent continents. Let that sink in for a moment.

## Projects 101
At my current company, the higher-level engineers are both Design Engineer and Project Engineer. We take a specified list of needs from the customer, determine what type of technology is most appropriate for that application, brainstorm with a team to develop some design concepts, narrow down the list to the most promising 2 to 3 concepts, and create a plan and timeline for the entire project from:
 - CAD model/drawing creation
 - material procurement
 - parts machining and assembly
 - internal development testing
 - external "field" validation testing
 - costing of the final working design at production quantities
 - hand-off to Manufacturing and product launch

That's a lot to keep track of! And this is done for each of possibly a handful of projects that the engineer manages simultaneously.

## Seeing the Trees vs. the Forest
Personally, I'm really good at being up-to-my-eyeballs in the details of things. I'm very comfortable being in the thick of things with a tough challenge to solve, and learning all the variables at play and all the possible solutions. That's where my brain is the most efficient.

Where it's least efficient is with the larger picture, and keeping track of all the moving parts (of one particular project and of all the projects I have at once). Knowing what the current progress is with the design of X while also knowing how far along a supplier is with making Y components. And what can be done in the meantime while waiting on these things. All the logistics are hard for me.

I decided early on that I needed a tool to help me see the big picture while also being able to record all the details. See, I'm also very methodical. I need to write things down as I go. I need to document things, both for myself later on, or for someone else years later.

## Inspiration: Excel Gantt v 1.0
I didn't make this from scratch; I actually found a much simpler version online when I'd searched for "Excel Gantt chart" or something similar. The original version was created by XXX (fill in this info later). What she had was exactly the skeleton I needed to work from. See below:
