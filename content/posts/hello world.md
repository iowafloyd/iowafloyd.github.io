Hello, World!
=============

I am **iowafloyd**.

As you may have guessed from the moniker, I (a) live in the United States state of Iowa, and (b) am very much influenced by the Prog Rock band Pink Floyd. Iowafloyd has been my online handle ever since the Internet grew from ARPANET in the 1990's.

I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering, and mechanical engineering has been my profession since the late 20-aughts. In my spare time, however, and when the need arises in my day job, I code. My company's IT team limits me to Excel and VBA, but outside of work I've used: QBASIC (for 90's DOS games), HTML/CSS/Javascript (for late 90's and early 2000's web design), and lately Python and a mixture of TensorFlow/PyTorch.

I've started this blog as a way to showcase both my abilities and my interests. If you've read this far, I hope that you come back sporadically to see this site grow with various new content week by week.

Until then, I'll just say:

> Hello, World!
