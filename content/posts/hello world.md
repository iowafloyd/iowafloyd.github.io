Hello, World!
=============

I am **iowafloyd**.

As you may have guessed from the moniker, I:
- live in the United States state of Iowa, and
- am very much influenced by the Prog Rock band Pink Floyd.

Iowafloyd has been my online self ever since I created my first email address in the mid-90's.

I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering, and mechanical engineering has been my profession since the late 20-aughts. In my spare time, however, and when the need arises in my day job, I code. My company's IT team limits me to Excel and VBA, but outside of work I've used
- QBASIC (for 90's DOS games)
- HTML/CSS/Javascript (for late 90's and early 2000's web design)
- Python and a mixture of TensorFlow/PyTorch for the past several years

I started this blog as a way to showcase both my abilities and my interests. If you've read this far, I hope that you come back sporadically to see this site grow with various new content week by week.

Until then, I'll just say:

> Hello, World!
