I DID IT!!!

I followed the YouTube tutorial of Ryan Schachte and, after numerous stops and starts, I have a blog on GitHub.

Note to self:
Add notes about learning:
1. How to install latest Git via Homebrew
2. How to generate an SSH key-pair, since username/password is deprecated
3. How to use Git from Terminal
4. How to clone the SSH repo after deleting the local HTTPS repo and initializing Hugo folder structure

But first, we will save this change, push it to GitHub, and make sure that it updates.+++
date = '2025-08-17T18:51:18-05:00'
draft = false
title = 'Hello World'
+++

Some content will go here. Once I figure out how this all works...
