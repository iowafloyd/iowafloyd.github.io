      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-college-doesnt-teach&#34;&gt;What College Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Teach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that my ABET-accredited degree did not teach me was just how much I would need some form of project managment in my professional life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s because, depending on the company you work for once you graduate, you may or may not need to have project management skills. Or maybe project management is just hard to teach out of a textbook. As someone who enjoys teaching others, I bet the latter is the true reason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
