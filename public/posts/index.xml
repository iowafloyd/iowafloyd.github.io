&lt;p&gt;One thing that my ABET-accredited degree did not teach me was just how much I would need some form of project managment in my professional life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s because, depending on the company you work for once you graduate, you may or may not need to have project management skills. Or maybe project management is just hard to teach out of a textbook. As someone who enjoys teaching others, I bet the latter is the true reason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;hello-world&#34;&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;strong&gt;iowafloyd&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may have guessed from the moniker, I:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;live in the United States state of Iowa, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;am very much influenced by the Prog Rock band Pink Floyd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iowafloyd has been my online self ever since I created my first email address in the mid-90&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering, and mechanical engineering has been my profession since the late 20-aughts. In my spare time, however, and when the need arises in my day job, I code. My company&amp;rsquo;s IT team limits me to Excel and VBA, but outside of work I&amp;rsquo;ve used&lt;/p&gt;</description>
